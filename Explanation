# -Opus-Magnum-C-book-of-Jerzy-Gr-bosz---exercises

Hi guys! Im writing this, because I really want to practise C++ and learn more about it. I want to post all exercises I've done from this book because it helps me to remember what I know. 
I'll try to change as much as I can but I won't promise that - as you know I'm still learning.

I really want to do my own projects later. Will post them on github too.
Hope you all enjoy your day!
