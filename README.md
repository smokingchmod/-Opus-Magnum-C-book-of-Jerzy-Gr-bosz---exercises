# -Opus-Magnum-C-book-of-Jerzy-Gr-bosz---exercises

Hi guys! Im writing this, because I really want to practise C++ and learn more about it. I want to post it because it helps me to remember what I know and it's my own portfolio.
I really want to do my own projects later. Will post them on github too.
Hope you all enjoy your day!
